Fuzzy C Mean Clustering:
From learning from previous method of Gaussian Mixture model we need to find a method that allow overlapping between the points and at the same time needs to take distance in the consideration between points in plotting . Therefore we now try Fuzzy C mean clustering which takes soft clustering into consideration which is a point can have a certain probability of being in one cluster and certain probability of being in another cluster and this it does on the basis of distance from the centre of the cluster . Thus it incorporates both the soft clustering model from the Gaussian mixture model and at the same time taking help of the K mean distance parameters .
