# Clustering_Model_FUZZYCMEAN

Using CLASS Function concept created a complete peipeline that helps us compare multiple clustering algorithms based on the Silhoute score and suggest the best clustering model for the data .
Then generates a complete result with the kepler plot . The model has been tested and prepared for real life data scenario and can solve real world cases.

## FUZZY C MEAN CLUSTERING 
Is based of the cpncept of deriving the core concept from K mean clustering and Gausian distribution . This helps it solve the the problem of over lapping values .
